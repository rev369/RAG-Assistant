# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses persistent ChromaDB tenant connection issues that occur when sessions are closed, requiring manual deletion of local embeddings. The solution will implement proper database connection management, automatic cleanup mechanisms, and robust session handling to prevent connection errors and ensure seamless user experience across application restarts.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle ChromaDB connections gracefully when sessions end, so that I don't encounter tenant connection errors on restart.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application session ends THEN the system SHALL properly close all ChromaDB connections
2. WHEN the application restarts THEN the system SHALL reconnect to existing embeddings without errors
3. IF a tenant connection error occurs THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt to reconnect or recreate the connection
4. WHEN connection issues persist THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want automatic cleanup of orphaned database connections and temporary files, so that my system doesn't accumulate unnecessary data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL check for and clean up orphaned connections
2. WHEN embeddings are no longer needed THEN the system SHALL provide an option to safely remove them
3. IF database files become corrupted THEN the system SHALL detect this and offer to rebuild the embeddings
4. WHEN cleanup operations occur THEN the system SHALL log the actions taken for transparency

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want robust error handling for database operations, so that temporary issues don't break my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
2. IF retries are exhausted THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade functionality and inform the user
3. WHEN connection errors occur THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic recovery before failing
4. IF recovery is impossible THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for manual resolution

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to manage database resources efficiently, so that performance remains optimal over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple database operations occur THEN the system SHALL reuse connections where possible
2. WHEN connections are idle THEN the system SHALL close them after a timeout period
3. IF memory usage becomes high THEN the system SHALL implement connection pooling and resource limits
4. WHEN the application shuts down THEN the system SHALL ensure all resources are properly released

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to use current, non-deprecated LangChain and ChromaDB APIs, so that the code remains maintainable and compatible with future versions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing ChromaDB classes THEN the system SHALL use langchain-chroma package instead of deprecated langchain-community classes
2. WHEN performing similarity searches THEN the system SHALL use correct API parameters supported by the current version
3. IF deprecated APIs are detected THEN the system SHALL migrate to supported alternatives
4. WHEN updating dependencies THEN the system SHALL ensure API compatibility across all database operations
